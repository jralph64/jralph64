### Interesting areas of Unity Learn:

With my interests primarily being with 3D modeling and animation, the Creative Core path of Unity Learn is very intriguing and sounds like a path I would enjoy taking. At the same time, the Junior Programmer path sounds like something I could learn a lot from, as I have not touched coding much at all during my time at ODU. 

### Semester project:

A. One option I'd like to do is to continue working on my *Super High T World* game that I started about a year ago, and with this being a 3D platformer I would be interested in trying the 3D Game Kit. I am open to starting new projects as well, in which case the 2D game and FPS creator kits sound intriguing to me. 

B. In *Super High T World*, you control the High-T guy in a sandbox 3D platforming environment (a la *Super Mario 64/Odyssey*) with an emphasis on combat. 

C. If focusing on the Creative Core path, my goals would be to create an interesting and professional-looking level to play in, and I would like to learn Cinemachine to create in-game rendered cutscenes. If focusing on the programming core, my goals instead would be to program a more complicated moveset for the player character, as well as enemy AI for the player to fight against. D. With both of these goals, I would like to explore animation systems and Cinemachine, as the idea of creating cutscenes and an idle animation for the High-T guy sounds like a lot of fun to me.
